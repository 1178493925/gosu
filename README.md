# gosu

This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that `su` and `sudo` have very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior.  They're also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case of `sudo`), which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat if all you need is "run this specific application as this specific user and get out of the pipeline".

The core of how `gosu` works is stolen directly from how Docker/libcontainer itself starts an application inside a container (and in fact, is using the `/etc/passwd` processing code directly from libcontainer's codebase).

```console
$ gosu
Usage: ./gosu user-spec command [args]
   ie: ./gosu tianon bash
       ./gosu nobody:root bash -c 'whoami && id'
       ./gosu 1000:1 id

./gosu version: 1.1 (go1.3.1 on linux/amd64; gc)
```

Once the user/group is processed, we switch to that user, then we `exec` the specified process and `gosu` itself is no longer resident or involved in the process lifecycle at all.  This avoids all the issues of signal passing and TTY, and punts them to the process invoking `gosu` and the process being invoked by `gosu`, where they belong.
